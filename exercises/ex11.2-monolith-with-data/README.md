# Starter code for exercise 11.2 - Monolith with data

The end goal of the exercise is to create a monolithic Spring-Boot application serving static,
server-rendered HTML pages. All the data is selected on the server and injected directly before
returning the HTTP response. Thymeleaf templates are used.

The starter code here provides only the backend logic of data - repository and service classes. Your
task is to create controller class(es) and integrate the static HTML+CSS code
from [here](../../example-07-monolith/00-static).
